# What is this?

This code is a partial implementation of an assembler and simulator for the
Intel 4004 microprocessor. A lot has been written about the Intel 4004 already,
so I am not going to explain its significance here, Google for more information
if you're curious.

# Is this unique?

Ummmm, no. There are at least two other Python Intel 4004 assemblers and
simulators out there:

 * https://github.com/CodeAbbey/intel4004-emu, which has been idle for nine years
 * https://github.com/alshapton/Pyntel4004, which has been idle for two years

Now, the Intel 4004 architecture has been stable for over 50 years, so its
entirely possible that a git repository without commits is simply "complete"
and not "abandoned", but either way I figure the best way to learn the
architecture is to write a thing, not to just use a thing. So think of this as
a learning space.
